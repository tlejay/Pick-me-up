# Feature Prioritization Framework

**Project:** PICK-ME-UP
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Session:** [Sprint Planning / Quarterly Review]
**Facilitator:** [Name]

---

## Prioritization Methods

### 1. RICE Scoring

**Formula:** RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort

#### Scoring Criteria

**Reach:** How many users/orders affected per quarter?
- Specific number (e.g., 1000 users, 500 orders)
- Use projected numbers for new features

**Impact:** How much will this move the needle?
- 3 = Massive impact
- 2 = High impact
- 1 = Medium impact
- 0.5 = Low impact
- 0.25 = Minimal impact

**Confidence:** How certain are we about Reach and Impact?
- 100% = High confidence (have data)
- 80% = Medium confidence (some data/research)
- 50% = Low confidence (hypothesis)

**Effort:** How many person-weeks to ship?
- Count all team members × weeks
- Include design, dev, testing, deployment

---

### 2. Value vs. Complexity Matrix

```
High Value, Low Complexity  → Quick Wins (DO FIRST)
High Value, High Complexity → Big Bets (Strategic)
Low Value, Low Complexity   → Fill-ins (If time permits)
Low Value, High Complexity  → Time Sinks (Avoid)
```

---

### 3. MoSCoW Method

- **Must Have (P0):** Critical for launch/success
- **Should Have (P1):** Important but not critical
- **Could Have (P2):** Nice to have if time permits
- **Won't Have (P3):** Explicitly out of scope

## Decision Framework

### When to Prioritize a Feature

**Ask these questions:**

1. **Does it solve a real user problem?**
   - Have we validated this with users?
   - How many users are affected?

2. **Does it align with our strategy?**
   - Which strategic pillar does it support?
   - Does it move our North Star metric?

3. **What's the opportunity cost?**
   - What else could we build with this effort?
   - What are we NOT doing if we do this?

4. **Can we measure success?**
   - What metrics will we track?
   - How will we know if it worked?

5. **Is now the right time?**
   - Do we have dependencies in place?
   - Is there urgency?
   - What's the risk of waiting?

### When to Defer a Feature

- ❌ "Nice to have" but not essential
- ❌ Low user demand or impact
- ❌ High complexity, uncertain value
- ❌ Missing critical dependencies
- ❌ Better alternatives exist
- ❌ Not aligned with current strategy

### When to Reject a Feature

- 🚫 Doesn't solve a validated problem
- 🚫 Misaligned with product vision
- 🚫 Too complex for the value
- 🚫 Creates technical debt
- 🚫 Security or legal concerns
- 🚫 Violates brand principles

## Appendix: Estimation Guidelines

### Effort Estimation (T-Shirt Sizing)

- **XS (1-2 days):** Simple changes, configuration, minor UI tweaks
- **S (3-5 days):** Small feature, simple API, basic UI component
- **M (1-2 weeks):** Medium feature, multiple components, some backend work
- **L (3-4 weeks):** Large feature, full-stack, multiple systems
- **XL (1-2 months):** Very large feature, complex integration, new system
- **XXL (2+ months):** Epic-level, requires breaking down

### Include in Estimates
- Design and planning time
- Development (frontend + backend)
- Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Code review
- Documentation
- Deployment
- Bug fixing buffer (add 20%)
