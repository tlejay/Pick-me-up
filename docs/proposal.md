## Executive Summary

PICK-ME-UP is a nationwide coffee shop aggregation platform focused exclusively on **Pick-up** and **Dine-in** orders, with **no delivery service**. The platform aims to reduce costs for both coffee shops and consumers while building a strong coffee community.

### The Business Opportunity

The Thai coffee market is valued at approximately **100 billion THB annually** with over **15,000 independent and SME coffee shops** nationwide. Despite this massive market, coffee shops are struggling with high platform fees that force them to either reduce margins or increase prices, making quality coffee less accessible to consumers.

### Problem Statement

Current food delivery platforms charge high commissions (25-35% per order), forcing coffee shops to increase prices significantly:
- **In-store price:** 70 THB
- **Delivery platform price:** 90 THB (+28.5% markup)
- **Shop's actual profit:** Reduced by 25-35% due to commission

**Impact on stakeholders:**
- **Coffee shops:** Forced to choose between lower margins or higher prices
- **Customers:** Pay 20-30% more for the same product
- **Market:** Quality coffee becomes less accessible, favoring larger chains over independents

### Our Solution

PICK-ME-UP offers a platform that:
- Charges significantly lower commission (5-10% vs 25-35%)
- Enables customers to purchase at in-store prices
- Eliminates the need for merchants to inflate prices
- Builds a coffee community through reviews and social features
- Creates sustainable revenue model for all stakeholders

### Investment Highlights

- **Total Investment (Phase 1 MVP):** 2,000,000 THB (50/50 split: DOS in-kind + Angel cash)
- **DOS Contribution:** 1,000,000 THB (development services)
- **Angel Investment:** 1,000,000 THB (marketing & operations)
- **Timeline:** 4-6 months to launch
- **Target ROI:** 2-3 years to positive return
- **Year 1 Revenue Target:** 3-4M THB (conservative MVP launch)
- **Market Strategy:** Niche focus on coffee shops only
- **Competitive Advantage:** 60-75% lower commission than competitors

**Realistic Exit Options (Year 3-4):**

**1. Strategic Acquisition**
- Potential acquirers: Food delivery platforms, payment companies, coffee chains, retail tech
- Valuation multiple: 2-3x revenue or 5-8x EBITDA (conservative for early stage)
- **Estimated valuation (Year 3):** 24M - 60M THB
  - Based on 2x revenue: 24M THB (12M revenue × 2)

  - Based on 5x revenue: 60M THB (12M revenue × 5, if strategic value)

**2. Series A Funding**
- Timing: Year 2 after proving business model
- Raise: 3-5M THB for Phase 2 features and expansion
- Pre-money valuation: 8M - 15M THB
- Investor equity: 20-30%
- DOS and Angel dilute proportionally but maintain control

**3. Bootstrap and Continue Operations**
- Maintain profitable operations without external funding
- Grow organically using revenue

- Valuation: Negotiated based on strategic value

### Investment Return Summary

**For 1,000,000 THB Investment (50% equity):**

**Conservative Scenario (Exit Year 3):**
- Company Valuation: 24M THB (2x revenue)
- 50% Equity Value: 12M THB
- Net Return: 11M THB profit
- **ROI: 1,100% (11x return)**

**Base Case Scenario (Exit Year 3):**
- Company Valuation: 40M THB (3.3x revenue or 5.5x EBITDA)
- 50% Equity Value: 20M THB
- Net Return: 19M THB profit
- **ROI: 1,900% (20x return)**

**Optimistic Scenario (Exit Year 3):**
- Company Valuation: 60M THB (5x revenue with strategic premium)
- 50% Equity Value: 30M THB
- Net Return: 29M THB profit
- **ROI: 2,900% (30x return)**

**Bootstrap Scenario (No exit, dividends only):**
- Year 3 dividend (40% of 7.2M EBITDA): 2.88M THB
- Annual dividends continuing
- 3-year cumulative dividends: ~5M THB
- Plus: Still own 50% of operating business
- **ROI: 500%+ (5x return) plus ongoing dividends**

### Risk-Adjusted Return (Phase 1 - 2M Investment)

**Risk Factors and Probability:**
- Market adoption slower than expected: 35% probability
- Competitive response or market changes: 25% probability
- Execution challenges (technical, team, operations): 20% probability
- Success as planned or better: 20% probability

**Expected Value Calculation:**
- Conservative Case (35% probability): 24M THB × 0.35 = 8.4M THB
- Base Case (25% probability): 40M THB × 0.25 = 10M THB
- Optimistic Case (20% probability): 60M THB × 0.20 = 12M THB
- Partial success / Bootstrap (20% probability): 15M THB × 0.20 = 3M THB
- **Risk-Adjusted Expected Valuation: 33.4M THB**
- **Risk-Adjusted Investor Return (50%):** 16.7M THB
- **Risk-Adjusted ROI:** 1,570% over 3 years (15.7x return)

### Key Investment Thesis

**Why this is an attractive investment despite smaller scale:**

1. **Capital Efficient:** 2M THB vs typical 10-20M THB for similar platforms
2. **Quick Payback:** 24 months vs industry standard 36-48 months
3. **Lean Operation:** Lower burn rate means longer runway
4. **Proven Team:** DOS has track record with similar platforms
5. **Clear Exit Path:** Multiple potential acquirers in growing market
6. **Asymmetric Risk/Reward:** Limited downside (2M), significant upside (20-30M)
7. **Market Timing:** Coffee culture growing, delivery fatigue setting in
8. **Defensible Niche:** Coffee-only focus creates community moat

**Bottom Line:** Even in conservative scenario with no exit, investors can expect **5-10x return through dividends alone** within 3-4 years. With successful exit, **15-30x returns are achievable**.

## Competitive Advantages and Moats

### 1. Cost Leadership in Niche Market
**60-75% lower commission than general platforms**

- **Economic advantage:** Shops save 15-25% per order
- **Pricing power:** Customers pay in-store prices
- **Volume driver:** Lower costs attract more merchants
- **Sustainability:** Business model works for all parties long-term

**Why we can sustain lower costs:**
- No delivery logistics infrastructure needed
- No driver management or routing algorithms
- Lower customer acquisition cost (focused targeting)
- Simpler operations = lower overhead

### 2. Network Effects and Community

**The more shops join, the more valuable the platform becomes**

- **Supply-side:** More shops = more variety for customers
- **Demand-side:** More customers = more orders for shops
- **Data advantage:** More transactions = better insights and recommendations
- **Community effects:** Reviewers attract followers, creating social network

**Defensive moat:** Once established, difficult for competitors to replicate the community and network density

### 3. Vertical Specialization

**Coffee-only focus creates deep expertise**

- **Product expertise:** Understand coffee shop operations deeply
- **Feature optimization:** Every feature designed for coffee ordering
- **Marketing efficiency:** Targeted to coffee enthusiasts only
- **Brand positioning:** "The coffee platform" vs "general food delivery"

**Competitive barrier:** General platforms cannot match depth of coffee expertise without diluting their broad positioning

### 4. Brand as Community Platform

**Not just transactional, but social and community-driven**

- **Trust network:** Follow reviewers you trust
- **Discovery:** Find new shops through community
- **Loyalty:** Supporting local businesses creates emotional connection
- **Engagement:** Beyond transactions, users engage with content

**Switching cost:** Users build social capital (followers, reputation) that doesn't transfer to other platforms

### 5. Technology and Operational Efficiency

**Built for scalability from day one**

- **Cloud-native architecture:** Auto-scaling, high availability
- **Mobile-first:** Optimized for smartphone usage
- **API-driven:** Easy integrations with other systems
- **Data-driven:** Real-time analytics and optimization

**Advantage:** Technology built specifically for this use case, not adapted from delivery platform

### 6. Strategic Partnerships

**DOS brings proven experience and relationships**

- **Technical credibility:** 10+ years, 100+ projects
- **Industry connections:** Relationships with major Thai corporations
- **Delivery expertise:** Prior work on Foodhunt, CPAC Delivery
- **Execution capability:** Track record of launching platforms successfully

**Barrier:** Competitors need both capital AND execution expertise

### Why Competitors Cannot Easily Copy

**Large platforms (Grab, Lineman) face strategic constraints:**
- Cannot lower commission without cannibalizing core business
- Cannot focus on coffee without alienating restaurant partners
- Delivery infrastructure is both asset and liability
- Organization optimized for broad market, not niche

**New entrants face chicken-and-egg problem:**
- Need shops to attract customers
- Need customers to attract shops
- PICK-ME-UP solves this through low commission and community
- First-mover advantage in building coffee shop network

**Timeline advantage:** 12-18 months to achieve critical mass creates defensible position
